tell me about all the important git command for the parallel process with the multiagent.
so when I go over how deos the Cladue ro Codex useres use AI.

they use multiple termianl windwo and do muliple process righT?

but I think they are working in the same dir but

use different worktree or branch right?


as far as I understood we can work differn branch with
a same single current working dir in our pc righT?


but at the same time we can work with a diferent working dir as mapped different branch right>


for instnace
let's say we ahve A/B branch and dir1/dir2


we can work by switching brach that

branch A - dir1 -> agent1
branch B - dir1 -> agent2


but at the same time


barnch A - dir1 -> agent1
branch B - dir2 -> agent2


and then, we can merge the project. right??

so tell me what is more effeicent in what situation .


in terms of currernt Claude agent system.


(find in the web how ppl use in reality)
