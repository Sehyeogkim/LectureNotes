so in here. search about the LLM + agent + (Computational analysis)
(computaotinl analysks : FEM FVM ...)


my interest is to build the agentic ai framekwork
in order to do more proeductive and effeivve for the compuational analysis works.


there are several ways as far as I concerned to achieve this.

1. build the pyhsical based Neurnal Netowkr
LLM is absed on the PINN but
Deep learning based pyhsics model is vcontinously one of the 
research topic for us. (compuatioanl anaylsis field)
- PINN is one of the most well-knowed example.


2. Build the agenttic ai framework.
agentic ai is separte with the LLM, it uses LLM
but fouces on how to use LLM
how do we gonnan input and output and use output to acheive our interst and sovle the prob,


As far as i understood thre are:
- COF (chain of tough skills)
- ReACt( Observe the rsults and put in on the inlet again)
- MCP (Open foam,  svFSI, simvasluar .... all the opensource
will be connevted to LLM that
LLM can autoamtaiclly do the simalti)

so I think. this framekwork must be designed and used
within a coupeled of years.



my interest is lean on more to the 2nd option rather than the 1st one.


but here's the Q.

find the latest famoue, promising and intersteing, breakttrhough reasearch
about 1st option and 2nd option each.


fid 5 journal papares for each options total 10 journal papers.

find the papres and create two md files as a anser.
1. option1.md
2. option2.md
in the cur dir.
